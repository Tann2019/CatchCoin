# CatchCoin Logo

Since we need a logo file, here are options for creating one:

## Quick Option - Text Logo
Create a simple text-based logo using CSS (already included in the website)

## Professional Logo Creation:
1. **Canva** (Free): https://canva.com
   - Search "cryptocurrency logo"
   - Use the coin/target theme for "catch"
   - Colors: Purple/Blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)

2. **LogoMaker** (Free): https://logomakr.com
   - Create a circular logo with "C" or target symbol
   - Export as PNG, 512x512 pixels

3. **Design Ideas for CatchCoin:**
   - Target/bullseye symbol (representing "catching" opportunities)
   - Coin with arrow pointing up
   - Hand catching a coin
   - Combination of "C" and target rings

## Temporary Logo
For now, the website uses emoji ðŸŽ¯ as a placeholder logo that represents the "catch" concept.

## To add a real logo:
1. Create/download your logo as "logo.png" (512x512 pixels)
2. Upload to GitHub repository
3. Update the metadata.json file with the correct GitHub URL
4. Update the website's img src to point to your logo file
